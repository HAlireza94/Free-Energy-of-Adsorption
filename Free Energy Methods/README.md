## Uncertainty in free energy calculation using Finite Difference Thermodynamic Integration  
Using bootstrapping methodology, I developed this code so that we can get the standard error coming from free energy calculation.
compile FEP.cpp, and execute it.
e.g., g++ -o fep FEP.cpp,   
then ./fep "output from fep" "temperature" "del-lammda" "number of Iterations"
