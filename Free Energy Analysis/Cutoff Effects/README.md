# What is the cutoff effect?  
To study this, we know free energy is an extensive property meaning it increases or decreases  
with system size.  
Here different system sizes are studied for metalic surface + water, we duplicate the system by Nx = 1, 2, 3 and Ny = 1, 2, 3:  
* Nx = 1 and Ny = 1  
* Nx = 2 and Ny = 2
* Nx = 2 and Ny = 3
* Nx = 3 and Ny = 3
