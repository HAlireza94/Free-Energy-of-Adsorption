# Free Energy of Adsorption
This is an ongoing project, where we are combining Density Function Theory (VASP) and Molecular Dynamics (LAMMPS) to execute free energy calculations using thermodynamic integration for polar and non polar catalytic species. Here, you have access to different scripts aiming to setup, clean, and calculate the free energy of these species adsorbed on different surfaces.
